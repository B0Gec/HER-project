# HER-project
running SINDy for HER colab with KI, ...

plan:

1 clustering experiments:
3 groups related to max of data:
14 max <= 0.002, 
[0, 14 frags 0.002, 7frags 0.02, 12frags 1]
three groups in the following separation of [0,1]
[0, 0.002, 0.02, 1]


Looking at lineplot graphs it would make sense as a rule of thumb to use 0.002 as a threshold for the number of fragments.
I.e. taking into account only top 19 fragments.
